## Automotive Engine Simulation (AES) ##

This Add-On is **deprecated** and is no longer updated with new features or bug fixes. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in new projects. A next-generation [Engine Simulation Toolkit](https://github.com/NIVeriStandAdd-Ons/Engine-Simulation-Toolkit-Custom-Device) is available. The new toolkit offers vast improvements to FPGA space utilization, RT performance, and many new features.

**Automotive Engine Simulation (AES)** is the raw AES IP before built into a VI package for distribution

### LabVIEW Version ###

LabVIEW 2010

### Built Availability ###

Built VI package of this IP is available on the [NI VeriStand Add-ons Community](https://decibel.ni.com/content/docs/DOC-5684)

### Quality, Limitations ###

This IP should be considered good quality and mature, but not as high of quality as the Engine Simulation Toolkit which replaces it. This IP has been used worldwide by many customers in deployed applications since early 2011.
